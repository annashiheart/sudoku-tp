# Sudoku
## 15-112 Term Project

### What is this?

Play Sudoku from your convenience of your personal laptop – anytime, anywhere!

You can solve puzzles ranging in difficulty (easy, medium, hard, evil). If you run out, you can upload your own puzzle in .txt format to the tp-starter-files folder or even create a custom board – the app will generate a solution for you!

The game can generate hints for you if you get stuck, and it can help show which values in a cell are legal and make your own notes to add or ban legals as you so wish.

By default, the game will alert you with red font (this can be changed in preferences!) if you input the incorrect value in the board or attempt to ban the cell's correct value from the cell's legals. In contest mode, however, making such mistakes will cause the game to end!

### How to Play!

You can play by running the main.py file.

You can see a list of the shortcut commands if you press the guide button with your mouse or the g button on your keyboard.
